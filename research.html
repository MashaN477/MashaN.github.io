        <h2>Academic Background</h2>
        <p>I'm currently pursuing studies in <strong>microbiology and infectious disease</strong>, with a focus on the holistic factors that influence immune function and disease outcomes. My academic work explores the traditional foundations of microbiology while my independent research investigates the broader context of health.</p>

        <h2>Primary Research Interests</h2>

        <h3>Holistic Epidemiology of Immunity</h3>
        <p>Exploring how the immune system is influenced by factors often overlooked in traditional epidemiology:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The impact of chronic stress and cortisol dysregulation on immune function</li>
            <li>Social determinants of immunity: how community connection affects disease resistance</li>
            <li>Nutritional status and micronutrient deficiencies in immune response</li>
            <li>Chemical exposures and toxic burden as immune modulators</li>
            <li>The role of overall disease state and inflammatory load in susceptibility to infection</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Microbiome as Foundation of Health</h3>
        <p>My passion lies in understanding gut health as the cornerstone of human wellness:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gut-brain axis and its implications for mental health</li>
            <li>Microbiome influence on immune development and regulation</li>
            <li>The role of dysbiosis in chronic disease</li>
            <li>Dietary interventions for microbiome restoration</li>
            <li>Long-term effects of antibiotic use on microbial ecosystems</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fascia as a Communication Network</h3>
        <p>Investigating the fascia network as more than structural tissue:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fascia's role in whole-body communication and integration</li>
            <li>The biological basis of embodied consciousness</li>
            <li>Fascial networks and immune function</li>
            <li>Somatic approaches to trauma and healing</li>
            <li>Connections between the fascial system and the microbiome</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ongoing Explorations</h2>

        <h3>Consciousness & Biology</h3>
        <p>While not strictly within conventional scientific frameworks, I'm deeply interested in the intersection of consciousness studies and biological systems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The neuroscience of meditation and contemplative practices</li>
            <li>Quantum biology and its implications for understanding life</li>
            <li>The nature of subjective experience and embodied awareness</li>
            <li>Integration of spiritual perspectives with rigorous science</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Research Culture & Publication Bias</h3>
        <p>Understanding how society shapes what we study—and what we don't:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How funding structures determine research priorities</li>
            <li>Publication bias and the "file drawer problem"</li>
            <li>The influence of pharmaceutical industry on research agendas</li>
            <li>Cultural assumptions embedded in research design</li>
            <li>Topics that are difficult to study within current paradigms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Writing & Communication</h2>

        <p>Beyond formal research, I'm committed to science communication that bridges academic rigor with accessibility. This website serves as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A platform for exploring ideas at the intersection of conventional and holistic science</li>
            <li>Practice in translating complex concepts for general audiences</li>
            <li>A space for synthesizing information across disciplines</li>
            <li>A demonstration of independent research and analytical skills</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technical Skills</h2>

        <p>In addition to biological sciences training, I'm developing technical capabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript (demonstrated by this website)</li>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Statistical methods for biological research</li>
            <li><strong>Literature Review:</strong> Systematic approaches to research synthesis</li>
            <li><strong>Scientific Writing:</strong> Academic paper structure and peer review process</li>
            <li><strong>Science Communication:</strong> Making complex topics accessible and engaging</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Current Projects</h2>

        <h3>This Website</h3>
        <p>A coding and writing project demonstrating my ability to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn new technical skills independently (GitHub, HTML/CSS)</li>
            <li>Communicate complex scientific ideas clearly</li>
            <li>Synthesize information across multiple disciplines</li>
            <li>Build and maintain a professional online presence</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Article Series on Holistic Immunology</h3>
        <p>Developing a series of articles exploring immune function from an integrated, systems-based perspective—addressing topics that don't fit neatly into traditional research but are supported by emerging evidence and clinical observation.</p>

        <h3>Research Proposal: Social Connection and Immune Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Conceptualizing a study design to examine the relationship between community belonging, stress biomarkers, and infectious disease outcomes—integrating social epidemiology with immunology.</p>

        <h2>Future Directions</h2>

        <p>I'm interested in academic and professional opportunities that would allow me to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Investigate the holistic factors influencing immune function and disease</li>
            <li>Bridge conventional microbiology with integrative health perspectives</li>
            <li>Contribute to research on the microbiome and its systemic effects</li>
            <li>Develop science communication that makes complex biology accessible</li>
            <li>Work with organizations that value innovative, systems-based approaches to health</li>
        </ul>
